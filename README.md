# Known Bugs
* Link moves faster moving diagonally than moving horizontally or vertically
* Link cannot attack more than once while holding down a movement key
* Environment Loading things NOT in order
* Link's attack animation is cut off prematurely when C is released
* Cannot cycle items or blocks when Link is moving
* More will come with implementing the collision, we're sure

# Some Tasks before Sprint 3
* Implement:
  - Add/implement more blocks/items and enemies
  - Create a boss enemy
  - Mainstream projectile classes
  - LOTS OF REFACTORING (getting correct sprite locations, commenting and much more)
  - Mainstream environment loading
  - Fix small errors as they come with these implemtations
