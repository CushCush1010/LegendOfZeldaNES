READABILITY & CODE REVIEW

SPRINT NUMBER: 2
.cs FILE NAME: EnemySpriteFactory.cs
CODE AUTHOR: Gary Zhu
TIME TAKEN: 20 minutes

Readability: : The code is readable. The variables are descriptively named, and they use proper camel case which makes them easy to read as well. The code does not have 
layers of nesting, so the logic is easy to follow. One thing to improve is the name of the methods. While Rope1 and Rope2 do indicate a difference in the textures, it is 
impossible to tell which sprite they are corresponding to unless I match it with the spritesheet. Therefore, it would be better if they were named a bit more appropriately with
their description. 

Code Quality: The code included in this file seems extremely modular. The logic that the methods follow to return the sprite instance is similar; therefore, adding more sprites
later is a matter of copying previous methods and changing the location on the spritesheet. One thing to change would be to set the framerate as a private member instead of creating a value
in each method since the framerate is common among all the animations. Another thing to improve is to encapsulate the animation parameters for similar sprites. Rope1() and Rope2() have the same
values for columns and rows.
