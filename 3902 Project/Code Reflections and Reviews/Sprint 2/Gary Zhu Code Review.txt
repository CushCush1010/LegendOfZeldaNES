Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

Since I take review of this code, 
I felt this code have a really good strucuture and clear variable name. 
I can clearly understand the functionallity of different constructors and classes. 
One thing need to get improved might be the there are many duplication code in some classes.
For example, it might have a better way to avoid duplication  "private bool IsMovementKeysPressed"

Quality

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

In my view, I think this code have a really good quality and include all of action that link needed. 
Also, this file did not put many alogirthm part since 
all of them get seperated in different folders. 
So I think if we try to add more action in here, 
it will be pretty to support the change since they have different algorithm to deal different actions.
