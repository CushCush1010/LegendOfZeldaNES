READABILITY & CODE REVIEW

.cs FILE NAME: ItemManager.cs
CODE AUTHOR: Hongxiang Wang
TIME TAKEN: 25 minutes

Readability: : This part of code has high readability. The variables are named descriptively, and the logic easy to understand.
The use of a dictionary for item management is very efficient. Also, I think there are a lot of switch statements in the Draw() and Update() methods, 
and this way is not flexible and simple enough. Instead of writing a separate case for each item, Draw() and Update() could be called directly from the items in the dictionary.

Code Quality: This part of code shows good practices of modularity and reusability. The responsibility for item creation is clearly separated from the rest of the logic. 
ItemManager is only responsible for switching, updating, and drawing items, while the factory is responsible for creating different types of items, which is a good design choice, 
and allows the system to expand easily as game become complex.
