Readability: The naming in your code is clear and consistent, all the comments are helpful, but a little more explannation could make
it clearer. The constructor provides a clear idea of what’s needed to create a BulletSprite, and including default values like 
size = 20 is a great touch! 


Code Quality: Overal, the code quality is good, showing clear structure and excellent focus on simplicity. All the method are well-defined
and logic are also easy to follow. Also, The use of overload Draw method is a good approach since it will be adaptable for future needs.
Overall, your approach makes the code robust while maintaining readability and efficiency.


Some advice: Remove the unused Draw() method or add a comment explaining its future use.
