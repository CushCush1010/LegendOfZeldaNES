# CODE REVIEW
* AUTHOR: EVAN CSUHRAN
* DATE: 10/21/24
* SPRINT #3
* FILE NAME: Environment Loading
* FILE AUTHOR: MAYANK KARNATI

# READABILITY:
* Decent readability since most of the code is seperated into methods that have clear purposes. Could have some more comments, but it's 
pretty understandable (at least in the thought of how it functions).
* It may be too long with 200 lines of code and could outsource some of the more general methods. IEnvironmentFactory is also quite big

# CODE QUALITY:
* Great technique with reading and listing the created sprites in the .csv files.
* Works well for switching between, meaning it is fast and responsive.
* It does need to be more implemented with Collision, but we ran out of time so it's fine for now. Should be easy to fix this week.

# FEELINGS ABOUT SPRINT:
* Feeling quite overwhelmed since we all have drastic differences in our approaches. Since, most of the time, the time spent on the sprint
is comprised of us explaining/showing our process for it. We spent at least 20 hours over the past week just deciding on different routes.
* Overall, I am concerned by the work load and expectations. However, I believe we can still catch up and, somewhat, easily refactor our
current state of code.
