# CODE REVIEW
* AUTHOR: EVAN CSUHRAN
* DATE: 10/21/24
* SPRINT #3
* FILE NAME: Environment Loading
* FILE AUTHOR: MAYANK KARNATI

# READABILITY:
* All code is well-laid out in the ICommand inherited methods and serves a distinct purpose to be used in later sprints.
* As for KeyboardController.cs, it is well laid out/commented on.

# CODE QUALITY:
* Great technique when implementing the ICommand design, with it being in content, under a commands folder, and generally clear comments on
all of the command's purpose(s).
* As for KeyboardController.cs, it uses all the commands well (also that all commands link and work 
properly to certain classes - NOT all classes, however, mainly Link() stuff).
* There are some bugs with how our Queue is currently set up, but they seem small (hopefully).

# FEELINGS ABOUT SPRINT:
* Feeling pretty good about our code so far, it can be better. Enemy classes are definitely our weak point, but
we also need to work on refactoring/moving code to more accesible classes (for example, we could have one global animation 
class, since itemAnimatedSprite can be used on almost any sprite, I think).
* We will also have to have a "World.cs", where we link all functionalities together, to help unify the code.
