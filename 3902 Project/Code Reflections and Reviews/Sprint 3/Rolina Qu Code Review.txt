Readability: The code is very readable, with descriptive variable names and method names. There are also descriptive comments attached to many of the methods to clearly indicate what is going on.

Code Quality: The code is generally fairly modular and understandable. I feel like there are some more global variables than absolutely necessary, and the precise workings of the dictionary might need some review, but overall it is fairly good code.
