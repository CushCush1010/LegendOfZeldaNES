Readability: The code is generally clear, with well-structured variables and a logical flow. The naming conventions for the variables are 
descriptive, which makes the code easier to follow. The use of camel case and detailed comments, especially in the constructors and methods, helps
clarify the purpose of each part. However, one potential improvement could be to break down some of the larger methods into smaller, more
focused ones. This would make the code even easier to navigate and maintain.

Code Quality: The modular design of the code stands out, particularly in the way the sprite rendering is handled. The separation of
animated and non-animated sprites and the reuse of logic between them contribute to a scalable structure. Nevertheless, there are a few areas
where the code could be optimized. For instance, the framerate logic is somewhat convoluted and could be simplified to make future 
modifications easier. Additionally, encapsulating common logic across sprites and animations (e.g., frame management) could help reduce redundancy.
