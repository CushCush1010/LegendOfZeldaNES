Legend of Chip - Sprint 3 Reflection

What we accomplished: 

	In the sprint 3 assignment, every group of members contributed to the assignment. We subsuccessfully achieved the required functionality. Link could make 
	the collision with bullets and blocks. Bullets will disappear when it hits the link player, and the block will stop the 
	movement of the link player. Also, the block could defend the bullets as well.We uploaded three different maps. Then, we could use 
	keyboards and mouse controllers to switch between the rooms. 
           	
	Before the project, we assigned different features to different members. Rolina and HongXiang focused on the collision interface
	design and link player collision. Gary and Jiaqing focused on the collision of the enemy and the bullet. Mayank and Evan focused on the 
	map and uploaded the sprites to the environment. Then, each sub-group tested the code functionality by themselves and used pull requests to 
	merge each feature onto the master branch.  Finally, we merged everything together into the final version of our project. 

What we need to improve: 

	Compared with the last sprint assignment, we faced the problem of every component being strongly correlated. This caused 
	some issues, such as group members needing to wait for other people to finish their part. So it affects our group's working 
	efficiency. Next time, we must figure out how everyone can start working simultaneously. Since this assignment meets up without 
	break time, we could have done better on time management. It caused every group member to rush to work on the last day. So, we need 
	to make a specific schedule about what to get down on a particular day.
