READABILITY & CODE REVIEW 
AUTHOR: Jiaqing Guan

SPRINT NUMBER: 3
.cs FILE NAME: BrownSlime.cs
CODE AUTHOR: Haibo Zhu
TIME TAKEN: 30 minutes

Readability:  This part of code has high readability. The variables are named descriptively, 
and the logic easy to understand. But there are some small issues, the variable names like _fireCounter and _moveCounter could be changed to more descriptive names 
like timeSinceLastFire and timeSinceLastMove, which would help to quickly understand what they do. 
Besides, the magic numbers of the screen size or movement speed should be replaced with named constants to make the code easier to understand and maintain.

Code Quality: This part of code shows good practices of modularity and reusability. The responsibility for BrownSlime creation is clearly separated from the rest of the logic. 
BrownSlime.cs is only responsible for updating, and drawing and , while the factory is responsible for creating different types of items, 
which is a good design choice,  and allows the system to expand easily as game become complex.
