Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

Since I take review of this code, 
I felt this code have a really good strucuture and clear variable name. 
I can clearly understand the functionallity of different constructors and classes. 
One thing need to get improved might be the put the update method in other file since the purpose of bullet sprite factory is to create bullet sprite.

Quality

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

In my view, I think this code have a really good quality and include all of functionnalities that bullet needed.
Then, I felt like the update and draw method should not be appeard in this file and it should be plance in somewhere else.
I felt like it will be better to create another method to handle the update and draw method in other file.
