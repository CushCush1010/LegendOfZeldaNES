READABILITY & CODE REVIEW 
AUTHOR: Jiaqing Guan

SPRINT NUMBER: 5
.cs FILE NAME: BigBoss.cs
CODE AUTHOR: Haibo Zhu
TIME TAKEN: 30 minutes

Readability:  This part of code has high readability. The variables are named descriptively, 
and the logic easy to understand. For example, _spritePosition indicates the sprite's position area,
and UpdateFrames explicitly conveys the ability to update animation frames. 


Code Quality: This part of code shows good practices of modularity and reusability. 
The responsibility for Big Boss creation is clearly separated from the rest of the logic. 
One thing that could be improved is to handle the logic in blocks, 
such as checking if the move counter is 0 before updating the position in the Update method, and simplifying the counter reset condition. 
Such improvements reduce the complexity of the code and make the behavior clear and easy to maintain.
