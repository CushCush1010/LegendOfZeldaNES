Specific comments on what is readable and what is not: 

Since I take review of this code, 
I felt this code have a really good strucuture and clear variable name. And it include all of the functionnalities
link collision neede and include manu different situation of differen link collision
I can clearly understand the functionallity of different constructors and classes. 
One thing need to get improved might be the too manu if else statement in the code, 
and it might be better to use switch case to replace it.

Quality

Specific comments on code quality
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:

In my view, I think this code have a really good quality and include all of functionnalities that link collision needed.
Then, I felt it will better to seperate the code into different files, or maybe classify the link collision more specifically.
