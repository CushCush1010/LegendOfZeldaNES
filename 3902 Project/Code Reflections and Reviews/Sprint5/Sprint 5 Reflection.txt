Sprint 5 Reflection
Overall, we managed to generally catch up with most of the missing functionality from Sprint 4, as well as performing several major refactors and other overhauls of the existing collision, environment, and keyboard input systems from Sprint 4. We also added features such as accurate and reliable damage and damage taking, knockback from damage, invulnerability frames, screen transitions between rooms, a start screen and scrolling story screen, a pause menu, and overhauled the HUD significantly. We also added multiple different sound effects for picking up items and several debug options, such as pressing H to get max health and C to view collision boxes. We fixed a significant amount of bugs as well over the course of the sprint, both those created by the new features and preexisting bugs, and generally performed a significant amount of code improvement via refactoring. 
In terms of processes done this sprint, our overall processes for delegating work and organizing in-person meetings to work together worked well, with all team members showing up consistently to work together. However, our processes were somewhat disrupted by Thanksgiving weekend and finals week, as some members found it difficult to work on the sprint over the break. In addition, we continued to run into issues with highly complex and coupled features, especially as we tried to add new ones on top of the old systems. Although our refactoring efforts managed to solve the worst of the coupling, we still had some issues with coupled classes behaving in difficult to predict ways, resulting in bugs that were difficult to track down and fix. Since this is the last sprint, we don't have anything we can improve for the next sprints, but ultimately we believe we did the best work we could together and generally enjoyed working together as a team.
